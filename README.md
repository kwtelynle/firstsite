# What I Love About Mangoes
Hi! This is a website dedicated to mangoes because I love them very much and they are the best fruit in my opinion!
Before you continue reading, check out this cool [video]([https://youtu.be/TluYloE1EMc](https://youtu.be/GPQ1wt-PusY) of how to cut a mango, just in case you need it. 
## Where are Mangoes from?
Mangoes are grown and imported from many countries. 75% of mango exports are from Asia, and India is actually the largest mango producer in the whole world! I love mangoes because you can find them almost anywhere and are very accessible. 
I mean, look at this beauty! ![Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Carabao_mangoes_%28Philippines%29.jpg)
## Taste Factor and How to Eat Them
Both unripe and ripe mangoes taste amazing! Heck, I even like dried mangoes! For ripe mangoes, you can blend their sweet nectar into a smoothie, add them as toppings to dishes like mango sticky rice, or eat them by itself! For unripe mangoes, you can eat them with Tajin or put them in salads! A favorite dish of mine is a Vietnamese mango salad (goi xoai) which is basically unripe or "green" mango mixed with a fish sauce mixture, shirmp or chicken (optional), cucumbers, crushed peanuts (also optional), onions, carrots, and chili (again, optional).
It doesn't look as good as my mother's, but here's a picture of goi xoai. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114511266/193100501-2f3d6605-44c8-46ed-a21c-d26388a05590.png)
## Benefits of Mangoes
Mangoes are a good source of magnesium, fiber, and potassium, especially if you're one of those people who don't really like bananas like me, but still want to get those same vitamins and minerals. Mangoes are also low in calorie and helps boosts your immune system. A personal benefit I love about mangoes is that mangoes are a healthy, refreshing option to fulfill your sweet tooth cravings. 
## Types of Mangoes
There are six major types of mangoes in the United States.
- Honey/Ataulfo
- Francis
- Hayden
- Keitt
- Kent
- Tommy Akins

Personally, my favorite is the Honey mango. It never fails in the sweetness factor, and it is so juicy.
## Where to Buy Mangoes?
You can honestly buy mangoes at almost any grocery store, but my family usually gets our mangoes at H Mart.
